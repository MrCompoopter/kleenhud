# Introduction
**Kleenhud** is a custom TF2 HUD edit, made from combining e.v.e HUD, ToonHUD, with my own fixes.

**Kleenhud** is my main TF2 HUD that i use, and i base this HUD for all of my other HUD projects like No White Borders HUD, e.v.e Kleen Edition, and Arsenal HUD.

# Installation
To download from github, you would need to
1. Click on the green button with the text "Code â–¼"

To install in TF2, put it inside your custom folder

# Troubleshooting
This HUD does not support HUD minmode, please disable minmode by typing this in console `cl_hud_minmode 0`

If the HUD crashes, delete the cfg folder
